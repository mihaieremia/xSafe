# xSafe Multisig UI

This is the source code of the xSafe Multisig UI for the Multisig SC developed by MultiversX team.

xSafe is the first Multisig UI developed with the goal of bringing the benefits of a multisig wallet in the hands of everyone!

We've tried to make it easy to use and self explanatory, but we're also working on setting up the help section.
